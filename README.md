[Truncatable prime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncatable_prime) is a prime number that when you successively remove digits
from one end of the prime, you are left with a new prime number. 

Examples: 997 is called a left-truncatable prime as the numbers 997, 97, 
and 7 are all prime. 7393 is a right-truncatable prime as the numbers 7393, 
739, 73, and 7 formed by removing digits from its right are also prime. 

The task is to find the largest left-truncatable and right-truncatable primes
less than 1.000.000.
